This is a project built as a tech test for a company named Superior Wellness. Its main function is to allow the user to input data and then display that data in the front end. I will be using Laravel as my php framework along side bootstrap and datatables.js to display the data


Once you have synced your DB, to populate it with some data you can run "php artisan db:seed" from the project root.
